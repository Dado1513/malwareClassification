## Malware Family Classification using CNN

> Malware family classification using CNN. The dataset used is [malimg](https://www.kaggle.com/afagarap/malimg-dataset).

This repository is for research purposes only, in fact, turning the malware into a grayscale image and resizing it will lose a lot of data.
